    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <section>
      <p> I graduated from Tufts University in Spring of 2019, and started working full-time at the Applied Economics Clinic (AEC). AEC is a non-profit dedicated to researching environmental, energy, and equity using applied methods - while training the next generation of technical experts/analysts and proactively working to promote diversity in the fields of economics, engineering, math, and the sciences.</p>
      
     <p> As an Assistant Researcher at AEC, I provide technical support in creating and publishing some of the following materials for our clients:</p>
      <ul>expert testimony</ul>
           <ul>economic/environmental analysis and modeling</ul>
      <ul>policy briefs</ul>
      <ul>reports and white papers</ul>

  <p>I double-majored in International Relations and Environmental Studies, and minored in Colonialism Studies. In spite of having a liberal arts background, I've always had an interest in coding and using technology for good.<p/>

  <h2>Technical Skills and Publications</h2>
   <p>At work, I've built on a variety of technical skills that help out with quantitative analysis, and have been key in learning how to tell a story with data. These skills include using Excel for analysis, data visualization, and building modeling scenarios, as well as mapmaking using GIS. I also have training and experience in: </p>
   
         <ul>the EnCompass Model for electric power planning</ul>
      <ul>energy sector dispatch and capacity expansion modeling</ul>
         <ul>consumer equity analysis</ul>
